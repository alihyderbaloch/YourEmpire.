Build a complete full-stack Network Marketing website called *YourEmpire* using Flask (Python), TailwindCSS, and JSON-based local storage.  
The system must be 100% offline — no external APIs or databases. All data must be saved in local JSON files.

🎯 Key Features:
1. *User Registration & Login*
   - Register new users with fields: Name, Email, Password, and optional Referral Code.
   - Automatically generate unique referral codes like “YE####”.
   - Store user data in users.json with their referral relationships.

2. *Referral & Wallet System*
   - Every user gets a referral link (e.g. /register?ref=YE1234).
   - When a referred user buys a package and admin approves it, referrer earns *50% commission*.
   - Each user has a wallet balance (in PKR) saved in users.json.
   - Wallet auto-updates on commission or withdrawal approval.

3. *Packages (YourEmpire Plans)*
   - Bronze → 450 PKR  
   - Silver → 1000 PKR  
   - Diamond → 1250 PKR  
   - Platinum → 2000 PKR  
   Store them in packages.json.

4. *Payment System*
   - User can buy packages via payment form.
   - Fields: package, payment method (Easypaisa / JazzCash), account number, account name, transaction ID, and optional screenshot upload.
   - All data saved in payments.json.
   - Payment status: Pending, Approved, or Rejected.

5. *Withdrawal System*
   - Users can request withdrawals (min 225 PKR by default).
   - Fields: amount, payment method, account details.
   - Store in withdraws.json.
   - Admin can approve or reject withdrawal requests.
   - Approved withdrawals deduct from user wallet automatically.
   - Admin can set or change the minimum withdrawal limit anytime.

6. *Admin Panel*
   - Hardcoded login:  
     Email: admin@yourempire.com  
     Password: admin123
   - Admin can:
     - View all users, payments, and withdrawal requests.
     - Approve or reject payments and withdrawals.
     - Manually adjust any user’s wallet balance (+/-).
     - Add, edit, or delete packages.
     - Adjust the commission percentage globally (e.g. 50%, 20%, etc).
     - Adjust minimum withdrawal limit.
     - Add WhatsApp and Email contact buttons for user support.
     - Upload ads (video/photo/download link) for the *Ad Section*.
     - Set how much PKR per ad view (even decimals like 0.00001 PKR).
     - Enable or disable Ad Section visibility for all users.
     - Track ad analytics: total ads uploaded, total views, and total ad payouts.
     - See general statistics (total users, payments, withdrawals, total commissions).
     - Change admin password manually.

7. *Ad Watching System (New Section)*
   - Add a "Watch Ads" button visible on the user dashboard (only if enabled by admin).
   - When enabled, users can view ads uploaded by admin:
       • Video ads (mp4, webm)
       • Image ads (jpg, jpeg, png)
       • Download link ads (e.g. app link or affiliate offer)
   - Each ad has:
       - Title
       - Description
       - Reward (e.g. 0.0005 PKR)
       - Type (video / image / link)
       - View limit per user (optional)
   - When a user watches or clicks the ad, the reward is added to their wallet automatically.
   - Prevent multiple rewards for the same ad per user per day.
   - Save all ad data and view logs in `ads.json` and `ad_views.json`.
   - Admin can:
       - Upload, edit, or delete ads.
       - Set PKR reward per ad.
       - View how many users viewed each ad.

8. *Forgot Password (Manual Version)*
   - Add a “Forgot Password” option where user enters their email.
   - System shows a message to “contact admin” for password reset (offline).

   - Prevent direct JSON access from browser.
